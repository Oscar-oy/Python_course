# Trim a Binary Search Tree

'''
Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary search tree and 2 numbers min and max, trim the tree such that all the numbers in the new tree are between min and max (inclusive). The resulting tree should still be a valid binary search tree. So, if we get this tree as input:

and weâ€™re given min value as 5 and max value as 13, then the resulting binary search tree should be:

We should remove all the nodes whose value is not between min and max.

def trimBST(tree,minVal,maxVal):
    
     tree.left # LeftChild
     tree.right # Right Child
     tree.val # Node's value
     
     if tree.left:
        if tree.left.val < minVal:
            tree.left = tree.left.right

        elif tree.left.val > maxVal:
            tree.left = tree.left.left
            
        if tree.left:
            trimBST(tree.left,minVal,maxVal)
